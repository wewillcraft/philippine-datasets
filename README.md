# philippines-datasets

A collection of cleaned and structured datasets from Philippine government
agencies.

üåê **API Available:** [https://philippines-datasets.nowcraft.ing](https://philippines-datasets.nowcraft.ing)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) (v1.40+ recommended)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (for data processing)
- [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/) account (free tier available)

### Setup Neo4j Database

1. **Create a Neo4j Aura Instance:**

   - Go to [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create a new database (AuraDB Free tier is sufficient)
   - Save your connection credentials:
     - Connection URI (starts with `neo4j+s://`)
     - Username (usually `neo4j`)
     - Password (auto-generated, save it securely)

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and add your Neo4j credentials:
   ```
   NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
   NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password-here
   ```

### Process and Import Data

1. **Process PSGC Data:**

   ```bash
   cd psa/
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   python3 parse_psgc.py
   ```

   This generates `psgc_data.json`, `psgc_data.csv`, and `psgc_data.jsonl` files.

2. **Import to Neo4j:**
   ```bash
   deno task import --clear
   ```
   This imports all PSGC data into your Neo4j database.

### Run the API Server

Start the development server with auto-reload:

```bash
deno task dev
```

Or run in production mode:

```bash
deno task start
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Available Deno Tasks

| Task             | Command                    | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`            | `deno task dev`            | Start server with auto-reload for development |
| `start`          | `deno task start`          | Start server in production mode               |
| `import`         | `deno task import`         | Import PSGC data to Neo4j                     |
| `import --clear` | `deno task import --clear` | Clear database and import fresh data          |

## API Endpoints

Once the server is running, you can access:

### List Endpoints
- `GET /` - API documentation and available endpoints
- `GET /regions` - List all regions
- `GET /provinces` - List all provinces with their region
- `GET /cities` - List all cities only (HUC, ICC, CC) with province and region
- `GET /municipalities` - List all municipalities only with province and region
- `GET /localities` - List all cities and municipalities combined (includes type field)
- `GET /barangays?limit=100&offset=0` - List barangays (paginated due to large volume)

### Detail Endpoints
- `GET /regions/:psgc_code` - Get region details with provinces
- `GET /provinces/:psgc_code` - Get province with cities/municipalities
- `GET /cities/:psgc_code` - Get city/municipality with barangays
- `GET /barangays/:psgc_code` - Get barangay details with full hierarchy

### Utility Endpoints
- `GET /search?q=<query>` - Search locations by name
- `GET /hierarchy/:psgc_code` - Get full hierarchy path for any PSGC code

### Example API Calls

```bash
# List all regions
curl http://localhost:8000/regions

# Search for locations containing "Manila"
curl http://localhost:8000/search?q=Manila

# Get hierarchy for a specific barangay (e.g., Barangay Laog in Angat, Bulacan)
curl http://localhost:8000/hierarchy/0301401007
```

## Data Sources

- **PSA (Philippine Statistics Authority):** Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC)
- **PHLPost:** ZIP codes
- **FOI (Freedom of Information):** Government data

## Deployment

### GitHub Actions Setup

To keep your Neo4j Aura free database active, set up the following GitHub secret:

1. Go to your repository's Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Add a new repository secret:
   - Name: `API_URL`
   - Value: Your deployed API URL (e.g., `https://your-api.deno.dev`)

The GitHub workflow will automatically ping your API daily to prevent Neo4j from hibernating due to inactivity.

## Impostor Syndrome Disclaimer

**We want your help. No, really.**

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not
ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at
all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source
projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code
isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's
trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes.
That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can
help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the
project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution
process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as
a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see
the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.

**Remember:**

- No contribution is too small
- Everyone started somewhere
- Questions are welcome
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Your perspective is valuable
